A simple app to help find your next apartment -

# Description

The Apartment List app is there to assist anyone looking for a new apartment to live in. Most of us have spend time looking for a new place to live and it is always a stressful time. This app will help minimize the amount of time spent weighing the PROs and CONs of the places you are interested in. We chose to allot multiple perimeters you can individualize on all the apartments you are looking at, giving you a visible score and ultimately leaving you with an obvious victor.

# About

I have lived and moved into and out-of 10 apartments and houses, so far in my short life. After living in every major part of atlanta and 3 major sections of Denver, half of them being apartments, I wanted a better way of scoring the places I was looking at. This app is designed to give you parameters that are typically important to the active individual. From pools, closet sizes, appliances, and an integration with google maps to find your work commute / distance to the closest dog-park; we are providing you the extra time-of-day and piece-of-mind while undergoing your next apartment search. About the only think we can't help you with is a guarantee on your neighbors!
